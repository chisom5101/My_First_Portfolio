    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is my first attempt at creating a webpage using HTML. I'm learning how to structure content properly with different heading levels and paragraphs.</p>
    
    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML elements. I'm creating a simple webpage with headings, paragraphs, and images to demonstrate fundamental web development skills.</p>
    
    <h3>Why Learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of all websites. It provides the structure for web content and is essential for anyone interested in web development. Learning HTML is the first step to becoming a web developer.</p>
    
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>After mastering basic HTML, I plan to learn CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. These three technologies form the core of front-end web development.</p>
